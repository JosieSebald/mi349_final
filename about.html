        Hello, my name is Josie Sebald. I'm an artist who is
        striving to work in animation at Disney or Pixar.
        I'm currently a junior attending Michigan State 
        University and pursuing a degree in Games and Interactive Media.
        <br>
        I've been drawing for as long as I can remember, 
        making it one of my favorite hobbies. I am skilled 
        in pencil drawing, 3D modeling, and 2D digital art, 
        but I mostly focus on 2D digital art. I am also 
        currently open for commission requests!
        <br>
        If you'd like to see a more professional version of my portfolio,
        check out <a href="https://sparklesketch.artstation.com/">my Artstation</a> profile!
